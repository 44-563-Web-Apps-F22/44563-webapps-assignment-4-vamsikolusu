        DRAMATIS PERSONAE
      
        King Paramount, the First (King of Utopia)

        Calynx (The Utopian Vice-Chamberlain)</h4>
        <h4 class="name cali">CAL</h4>  <p class="speech"> England has made herself what she is because, in that
            favored land, every one has to think for himself.  Here we have
            no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all our wants,
            and our political opinions are formed for us by the journals to
            which we subscribe.  Oh, think how much more brilliant this
            dialogue would have been, if we had been accustomed to exercise
            our reflective powers!  They say that in England the conversation
            of the very meanest is a coruscation of impromptu epigram!</p><br>
            <p class="direction">(Enter Tarara in a great rage)</p>
          
            <h4  class="name phanter">PHA</h4><p class="speech">Scaphio, I think you once told me that you have never
            loved?</p>
            <h4  class="name scappy">SCA</h4><p class="speech"> That is surely something.  Come, take heart, boy!  you
                are young and beautiful.  What more could maiden want?
              </p>
              <h4  class="name chowdary">CHO</h4><p class="speech"> No, no—it does not interfere
              With our enjoyment much.</p>
            <h4  class="name king">kIN</h4><p class="speech"> That being so, as you insist upon it,
                We have arranged that our two younger daughters ho have been "finished" by an English Lady—</p><br>
          <p class="direction"> (Presenting a cracker which Calynx pulls.)</p>
            <h4 class="name nekking">NEK</h4><p class="speech"> Which is an awkward time because
                It cuts into our lunch.</p><br>
