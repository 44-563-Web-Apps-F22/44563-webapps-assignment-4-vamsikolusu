    <h4>UTOPIA LIMITED
        OR
        THE FLOWERS OF PROGRESS
      
        Music by Sir Arthur Sullivan
        Libretto by William S. Gilbert
        DRAMATIS PERSONAE
      
        King Paramount, the First (King of Utopia)
        Scaphio and Phantis (Judges of the Utopian Supreme Court)
        Tarara (The Public Exploder)
        Calynx (The Utopian Vice-Chamberlain)</h4>
        <h4>CAL</h4>  <p> England has made herself what she is because, in that
            favored land, every one has to think for himself.  Here we have
            no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all our wants,
            and our political opinions are formed for us by the journals to
            which we subscribe.  Oh, think how much more brilliant this
            dialogue would have been, if we had been accustomed to exercise
            our reflective powers!  They say that in England the conversation
            of the very meanest is a coruscation of impromptu epigram!<br>
          
            (Enter Tarara in a great rage)
          
            <h4>TAR</h4>:   Lalabalele talala!  Callabale lalabalica falahle!<br>
          
            <h4>CAL</h4>:   (horrified)  Stopâ€”stop, I beg!  (All the ladies
            close their ears.)<br>
          
            <h4>TAR</h4>:   Callamalala galalate!  Caritalla lalabalee kallalale<br>
